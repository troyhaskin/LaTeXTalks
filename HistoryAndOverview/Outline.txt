Hello
    - Troy Haskin
        - Born in Milwaukee, WI
        - Senior Graduate Student
        - Advocater of Fortran, malty beers, whiskey, and linear combinations of extremes
        
    - (La)TeX
        - 


History
    - Donald Knuth
        - Born in Milwaukee, WI
        - Professor Emeritus at Stanford University
        - Father of the analysis of algorithms
        
        - Brief History
            - Received preliminary versions of revised The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2
            - Publisher had switched to a digital typesetting program
            - Could not stand how ugly it was and decided to do better
            - After a year of development ... 

    - TeX is born
        - One-year initial development (pre-release version)
        - A lot of research into typography
        - Goal: generate beautiful documents


TeX
    - How to pronounce it?
        - Abbreviation of the Greek word "techne" meaning "art" (root of "technology").
        - Pronounced "tek"

    - What is it?
        - Program 
            - Application that reads an input file and produces a document
            - More on this later
        - Typesetting language
            - Targeted at typesetting a document, especially with a lot of math.
            - Turing complete language (some people have too much fun with it).
            - Difficult to pick-up; harder to master.
            - Typographically and structurally: a lot of onus on the user.

LaTeX (A Document Preparation System)
    - How to pronounce it?
        - Simple concatenation of "La" and "TeX"
        - Pronounced "Lay-tek" or "Lah-tek" (LaTeX3 Team)

    - What is it?
        - Developed by Leslie Lamport (the "La") in mid-1980s
        - Collection of utilities and rules for sound typography
        - High-level conventions for document structure
        - Facilities for user-defined packages for niche purposes (CTAN)
    
    
Motivations ("With great power ...")
    - Documents look damn good
    - Free and open source
    - Users write text files which are hard to corrupt and easy to share
    - Puts emphasis on structure and content
    - Ability to make commands and templates to lower repetition
    - Extremely powerful for making long documents
        - Separate file includes
        - Tables, figures, etc. not allowed to break across pages
        - Cross-referencing is extremely easy (and fairly reliable)
        - "Clickable" PDFs possible and very easy
        - Create "short cuts" for often used phrases, equations, etc.
        - Excellent bibliography and index maker (more later)
    - Type what you mean
    - There's a package for that.
    - Easier to version control than binary/obfuscated-XML files (e.g, .doc/.docx)


Caveats ("... comes great responsibility.")
    - Bit of a learning curve (same with Word, Pages, etc. but usually ignored)
    - Best learned by doing, trying, asking, and learning (if needed, also web searching)
    - Requires write-build-view and repeat mentality
    - "Easy stuff" can be hard (if packages don't exist)
    - Document creation throws errors and warnings
        - Forget a closing brace
        - Misspell a command
        - Under-/over-fill a box
        - Try to do something clever
        - others
    - Forced to use word processors due to LCD.
